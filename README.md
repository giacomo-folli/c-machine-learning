# c-machine-learning

This project contains several small C programs that demonstrate machine learning concepts.

## Files

- `main.c`: A simple linear regression example that attempts to learn the relationship between x and 2x.
- `gates.c`: A neural network implementation that learns the OR gate using the sigmoid activation function.
- `twice.c`: An incomplete attempt to implement a neural network for the OR gate. It calculates the cost but does not train the network.
- `build.sh`: A script to compile all the C files.

## Build

To build the project, run the `build.sh` script:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This will compile all the C files and create executable files in the current directory.

## Outputs

The `outputs/` directory is intended to store the output of the programs. However, it is not currently used by any of the programs.
